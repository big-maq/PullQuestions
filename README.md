# PullQuestions
Unlocked(Editable) cells are considered response cells and the text in cells to the left or top of response cell is considered as the question. 
Address of response cell is saved to a sheet so that later another macro can pick all the responses from all questionnaire files in a folder. Also, the questions are saved, which can later be pasted to the sheet containing all responses to begin analysis.
-To ease unlocking of response cells, a macro that unlocks cells of a particular color is available (not uploaded yet) so that it picks from the formatting that you probably have done to mark the response cells for the sheet user.
