# PullQuestions
Pull questions and the answer cells from a form made on excel sheet using VBA.
Unlocked(Editable) cells are considered response cells and the text in cells to the left or top of response cell is considered as the question.
-To ease unlocking of response cells, a macro that unlocks cells of a particular color is available (not uploaded yet) so that it picks from the formatting that you probably have done to mark the response cells for the sheet user.
